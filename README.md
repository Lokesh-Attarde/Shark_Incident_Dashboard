* **Country** : Name of Country where the incident happened.
* **Gender** : On whom Sharks attacks.
* **Month** : Month when incident happened.
* **Number of Records** : Count of how many times the incident happened.
* **Shark Species** : Species of the Shark with which people get attacked.
* **Year** : Year when the incident happened.
* **Is Fatal** : Whether people who have got attacked by the Sharks have died or not.
* **Is Provoked** : Whether Sharks deliberately get annoyed by people or not.

Out of the 10 features given in the datasets, 04 are Continuous and 06 (including the target variable) are Categorical features.

# 🏽‍ Conclusions
* With an average Age of 27, around 6000 incidents have happened.
* Clearly from the 1990s, the incidents are on the rise.
* 141 is the highest Number of Incidents that happened in a year and 21 is the highest Number of Fatalities.
* From Fatality Ratio vs Shark Incidents, we can make inferences like - Shark Incidents for Great White Shark are much larger than all other Sharks.
* Majority number of Incidents happened in the USA, but fatalities happened mostly in Australia.
* Most incidents were caused by Swimming and Diving activity.
* Male gender has gone through more incidents. However, in terms of the Fatality ratio, there is not much difference between both genders. Males have around 25.9% and Females have 20.2%.
